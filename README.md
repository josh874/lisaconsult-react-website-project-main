SPA - End of module project:
1. Time allowed:
Coding: 3.5 days (until the end of the day on Tuesday 26th April)
Presentations: ~ 0.5 days
2. Instructions:
Create a React SPA on a theme of your choice!
Try to use as much of the material we have covered during the module as you can. This can include, but is not limited to:
The useState, useEffect and useContext hooks.
Event handlers (e.g. onClick, onChange, onSubmit) to respond to user actions
Multiple "view" components
Routing using React Router (to move between views in your app), including at least one dynamic route
Using props to pass data down one or two levels.
JSX lists created from an original data array using .map()
At least one React form, using controlled components and with user input validation
You should spend at least 30 mins - 1 hour this afternoon planning and wireframing your project before you start coding. This will save you time later as you will know what you are aiming to create. :slightly_smiling_face:
When you are ready to start coding, you can use create-react-app to create your app: npx create-react-app name-of-your-app
